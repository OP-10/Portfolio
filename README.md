# Project2: Interest calculator:

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This project is an interest calculator that allows user input with a display, which will then use the input numbers to calculate interest.
  To do this the calculator uses interest rate, initial investment, monthly investment that is added each month, and the length of time of the investment.

## What did you do particularly well?

  What I did well was making the program simple to understand from the user's point of view and a coding point of view. 
  It's very easy to use with clear prompts to the user on what information to enter.
  the code is well organized with comments telling what each section of the code does.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I could enhance it by using an external menu, and not using the IDE or a console to run the code.
  This menu would make the program more user friendly and add more ease of use.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?\

  The most challenging code to write was m all of the different calculations. If they were wrong by any amount then the program would be pretty much useless.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  Some skills I will take away from this project are how to properly make code organized and how important doing this is while also making the program understandable on the user end.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I made my program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using comments to explain my code, by making my code well organized so others can understand it better and making it easily readable.
